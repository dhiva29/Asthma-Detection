# Asthma-Detection
Asthma Disease Prediction Project: Built ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict asthma using health and environmental factors. Used SMOTE for imbalance, scaling, cross-validation, and found Random Forest performed best for accurate risk prediction.
